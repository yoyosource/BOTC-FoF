# Design Principle Potions
1. Good Potions help Good
   All Potions help evil
2. Evil Potions are passive or triggered (vote/nominate/madness/...)
3. Good Potions active, passive or triggered; Evil Potions passive > not too obvious what they do
4. Potions will be designed that they break when you die/are exiled/travel out
5. No Potion Unique Mechanic (e.g. Death Prevention)
6. Cauldron!
7. Potions are Personal! > It only affects yourself! / You are not making a decision for another player!

### Glossary
**Emptied**: A potion that is "Emptied" is removed and replaced by an Empty Potion.  
**Cauldron**: A separate town square specifically for potions.  
**Nullified**: A potion being nullified means that its ability has been removed.  
**Type of Potion**: Specific Potion i.e. the name of the Potion.  
**Potion Alignment**: The good and evil categories like for characters.  
**Becomes**: The potion is changed from its current type to another, and is treated as if being received.  
**Special**: A character type that is not included in the bag setup and can only be created by another character's ability. Special characters are neither good nor evil.
